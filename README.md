# Escape from Dungeon 2

Yet another attempt to port my Escape from Dungeon game to a new library.
This version will be using ECS instead of my old OO paradigm, with Monogame as the underlying graphics/sound/input library.

# Todo:
~~ - Proper Text System (not just a font drawing system)~~
 - Attacking
 - Enemies
 - Enemy movement
 - Items
 - Controller support
 - Configuration
 -
